Frequently Asked Questions:
========================

Why would I want to disable the plugin update system?
Most people will not want to (and should not) disable this feature. It's a fantastic feature WordPress and I'm fully in support of it. However, administrators who maintain multiple installations of WordPress on behalf of other people (eg. clients) may not want plugin update notifications to be shown to the users of these installations. This plugin is for them.

To enable notifications should disable the plugin again?
Not necessary. You just need to enter the panel "Silence Options" and from that place can be given whether to enable / disable notifications.
